# 💳 Loan Approval Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant demographic and financial data.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Collected and cleaned the Loan Approval Prediction dataset.
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables for modeling.
- Built and trained classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression).
- Evaluated model performance using **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** to address class imbalance.
- Focused on improving decision support for financial institutions.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Experiment with ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: core language  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: data preprocessing and handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**: model building and evaluation
